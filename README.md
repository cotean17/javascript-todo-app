# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually strengthening my understanding of JavaScript by building small, focused applications that demonstrate key language features. For this module, I created an interactive To-Do List application that runs entirely in the browser. It showcases my ability to work with core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, ES6 array methods, recursion, exception handling, and integrating external libraries.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my fluency with JavaScript syntax and practice structuring code into reusable functions. I also wanted hands-on experience using a third-party library, handling runtime errors, and updating the user interface dynamically based on application state.

# Development Environment

I built this application using the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code** for writing and organizing code  
- **Live Server extension** to quickly preview the application in the browser  
- **Google Chrome** Developer Tools for debugging  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and publishing the project  

Programming Language & Libraries:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — main programming language  
- **HTML & CSS** — structure and styling  
- **Day.js** — external JavaScript library used to generate human-readable timestamps for tasks  
- **Built-in Web APIs** — DOM API, event handling, error throwing/handling  

# Useful Websites

These resources were especially helpful during development:

- [MDN JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Day.js Documentation](https://day.js.org/)
- [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features I would like to implement in the future:

- Add localStorage support to save tasks between browser sessions  
- Add categories, due dates, and sorting/filtering options  
- Add animations for adding and removing tasks  
- Improve accessibility for keyboard-only navigation  
- Convert the app into a small component-based project with modules
